  create account by clicking on that link 
  after creating account ,user can login to application ,then user will be routed to currency conversion page
  user can do currenct conversion on currency conversion page
 user can view the history of his last conversions by clicking on view History button 

i have used cache for this view History function call.

so some times when user does the currency conversion and if user clicks on view history ,it will not immediatly fetch the result from the DB ,
if cache time expires then it will fetch the data from DB.
